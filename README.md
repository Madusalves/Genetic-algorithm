# Genetic algorithm
In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by 
the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA).
Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by 
relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.[1] Some examples of GA 
applications include optimizing decision trees for better performance, solving sudoku puzzles,[2] hyperparameter
optimization, causal inference,[3] etc.
